               <p>
Ramadan falls on the ninth lunar month in the Islamic Calendar. <br>The lunar calendar means the start of each month is based on various factors, such as the sighting of the moon. Therefore, like all Islamic months, the month of Ramadan rotates every year.<br>
The month of Ramadan is believed to be the month in which the Holy Quran was revealed to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), as a guidance for all mankind.<br>
Ramadan is the month of fasting. Fasting (sawm) is one of the Five Pillars of Islam.
          <br>
       Fasting is not limited to not eating or drinking between the hours of sunrise and dusk. Among many other things, it entails abstaining from wicked behaviors including cursing, lying, ill intents, and having sexual interactions. This could render a fast invalid. <br>
A dua (prayer) of niyah marks the start of a fast (intention). 
<br>One common practice is to break the fast by eating dates. It is stated that the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) broke his fast with dates. But what exactly happens on a date? Dates have a wide range of health advantages. They are rich in fiber, have a lot of natural sugars, are great for digestion, have a ton of vitamins and nutrients, and so much more!
<br>
                 
            
           The month of Ramadan is blessed for charity and giving. <br>The sawab (reward) for generosity and altruism in this month is enormous. It is seen as a time for simplicity, humility, and remembering those who are less fortunate than us. In this month, many people decide to make donations in honor of Ramadan. Some choose to make recurring donations, others donate their time to one of the numerous campaigns, while still others choose to raise money for charitable causes.<br>
               Eid ul-Fitr, a holiday that follows the fasting month, marks the end of Ramadan. It is regarded as a day of celebration and giving thanks to Allah for His strength during the spiritual month. <br>It is a day of thanksgiving, prayer, harmony, and joy. Many people's days often include going to the mosque, praying, visiting family and friends, exchanging gifts, giving to charities, and eating a lot of food! <br>
Ramadan, however, isn't the same for everyone in practice. Some people practice Ramadan without the iftar to break their fast or the suhoor to start it.<br>
